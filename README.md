# Web Crawler Detection
This work is the final project of [Rahnema College](https://rahnemacollege.com/courses/machine_learning_fundamental) Machine Leaning internship program.
The aim of this project is to train an unsupervised model in order to recognize the web requests given to [Sanjagh Website](https://sanjagh.pro) are crawlers or not.
Finally, for taking advantage of this work, we had to create and develope a web application for production phase.


## Dataset

The dataset has been obtained from the Sanjagh server logs. Altough it cannot be publicly released, a tiny sample of can be found in `output.log`. In case you are intersted in the complete dataset, you can use any other nginx log servers available in the world wide internet.

A sample record structure is as follows:

`207.213.193.143 [2021-5-12T5:6:0.0+0430] [Get /cdn/profiles/1026106239] 304 0 [[Googlebot-Image/1.0]] 32`
